# SC2-Audio-Builder-Auto-Parse

Takes ".SC2Replay" File, uses https://github.com/StoicLoofah/spawningtool to create a readable JSON file containing the build order. The file in this repo parse.pl then takes the output from spawning tool and creates a format valid for https://github.com/mogoh/sc2audiobuilder (http://ab.mogoh.de)
